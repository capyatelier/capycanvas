# GTK SDR color milestone 2 — implementation and validation

Work begins at `e46f271` on 2026-09-13. Milestone 2 is **in progress**;
this report is not a declaration that the new modes are qualified. Scope is
shared implementation and GTK integration. Other host integration requires the
user's approval after GTK qualification.

## Independently checked prerequisites

The milestone 1 archive/replay replacement is present: immutable compressed
256×256 raster revisions, affected-tile history, asynchronous capture, indexed
project storage, GTK atomic publication, and failed-worker recovery. The
historical research document's descriptions of linear8 painting and stroke
archives do not describe this checkout. Current painting and physical effect
boundaries use `Rgba8UnormSrgb`, with linear-premultiplied Float32 shader values.

Remaining prerequisites before enabling large integer16 documents:

- Pixel descriptors, plane validation, source stride calculations, GPU formats,
  sampling and export accept only sRGB8/R8. Extend the complete precision path;
  a 16-bit container or retained original alone is insufficient.
- Raster restoration decodes every replacement into a simultaneous CPU vector.
  Bound scratch while retaining atomic failure behavior and exact undo.
- Source CPU pixels, a full immutable GPU source, materialized paint pages and a
  full composite coexist. Image-boundary filters retain further full-resolution
  textures. Bound and account for source, composite, effect and output work
  before qualifying dense photos.
- The working-format example establishes equal-kernel format costs, not the
  accuracy/cost of a complete integer16 edit pipeline. Repeat it and add
  operation-specific precision checks before selecting working buffers.
- Prior native pacing measures software input-to-presentation feedback. It is
  not physical pen-to-photon measurement or calibrated-monitor qualification.
- Apple and Windows milestone 1 host lifecycle qualification remains incomplete
  in the historical evidence. It is outside this GTK implementation phase.

## Reference and acceptance policy

Use the [common gates and milestone 2 scope](color-management-milestones.md),
with exact sample/profile persistence, one-step conversion undo, declared
operation tolerances and separately measured CPU/GPU/presentation boundaries.
Investigate unchanged-path p95/p99 increases greater than
`max(5% of baseline, 0.20 ms)`, against both the fresh fixed baseline and the
parent of each significant implementation stage. Repeated baseline runs retain
noise; missing budgets/measurements do not pass a new mode.

Primary references checked during implementation:

- [W3C color conversion definitions](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#color-conversion-code)
  for standard-space transfer, primary matrices and D50/D65 adaptation.
- [PNG third edition](https://www.w3.org/TR/png-3/#11cICP) for metadata precedence
  and matching encoded samples and color tags.
- [Pinned wgpu texture contracts](https://docs.rs/wgpu/30.0.1/wgpu/enum.TextureFormat.html)
  for format capabilities; normalized16 is not an automatic transfer decoder.
- [Little CMS](https://www.littlecms.com/color-engine/) as an independent ICC
  reference. Installed native reference library: 2.16.

## Fresh baseline

Fedora 44, kernel `7.1.10-200.fc44.x86_64`; NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell Max-Q,
Vulkan driver 610.57.04, 97,887 MiB GPU memory, configured power limit 250 W.
Use `LAYER_GPU_INDEX=0`; record adapter PCI identity in the kernel/native runs.
Hardware access requires running outside this session's device sandbox.

Rebuild the unmodified checkout with `cargo build --release -p layer-bench
-p layer-linux --examples --bins`. Run without concurrent builds or other test
processes:

```sh
LAYER_GPU_INDEX=0 target/release/gpu-bench --scenario all --repeats 3 \
  --output-dir artifacts/color-m2/baseline-images \
  --report artifacts/color-m2/baseline.md
```

Repeat with `baseline-repeat` paths. The first run covers 10,920 frames, with no
Move/Pen-up completed sample over 8.33 ms. Per-scenario CPU frame p95 ranges
0.080–2.082 ms; p99 ranges 0.144–4.748 ms. The 4.748 ms tail is the small
dual-texture scenario and requires the repeat/noise comparison. Capture
allocated/reserved peak reaches 184.2 MiB. Setup, compilation, export and
presentation are excluded from these timing distributions. Generated artifacts
remain local; subsequent sections retain qualification measurements here.

GTK workflows, dense-photo budgets, integer16 accuracy, profiled interchange,
managed-view tests and final regression qualification are still outstanding.
